I am quite happy with how the game looks and feels, but the difficulty remained slightly too\n                    much for some players. Additionally, some of the game design did not fit the overarching theme of the jam which was to make a speedrun game. Forcing\n                    the player to go slow at times was certainly a poor decision in this regard.
