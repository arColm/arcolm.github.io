We were quite happy with the placement for presentation, and\n                    although much of it was because of the artist who drew all of the textures, I was quite happy with the particle effects and other\n                    visual effects that I contributed. The overall score was not as high as I had hoped, especially since this is one of my favorite games that I have\n                    made - but by looking at the criticisms we received, I believe it was more of a misunderstanding of the target audience in the game jam. I had\n                    attempted to make this game fairly easy, and everyone who had the chance to playtest it gave feedback that it was indeed easy. However,\n                    many people thought it was difficult, so while I hate to blame my audience, I think this is the best compromise between me wanting to\n                    make a challenging game, and a game that is easy to beat for a jam. Another significant reason for our downfall is likely due to\n                    poor tutorialization of the game, and we realized this after having some of our friends play after release, that the tutorial\n                    did not illustrate all of the mechanics very clearly.<br>\n                    My goal for this jam was to continue improving the organization and architecture of my games. In particular, I wanted to reduce the coupling between my scripts,\n                    and especially to stop myself from using a Singleton for the player, despite its convenience. To this extent I largely used events with the\n                    Observer pattern. On top of this, I wanted to continue practicing visual effects, which is can be shown in the lightning effect of the game.\n                    In the future I would have liked to experiment with implementing the lightning effect with shaders or compute shaders if possible, instead of\n                    a set of line renderers, but given the time constraint of the jam I did not have time to learn for the game. Finally, I also just\n                    wanted to improve my ability to work with someone else on a game, and I think we worked together much better this time around, finishing\n                    most of the game within 48 hours of the 72 hours alloted.<br>\n                    Overall I consider this a fairly successful game.\n                    ';break;case"cardinal":n.innerHTML='<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/2730814?border_width=0&amp;bg_color=00303b&amp;fg_color=f1f2da&amp;link_color=8c8d79&amp;border_color=333333" width="550" height="165"><a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/cardinal">CARDINAL by arColm</a></iframe>',i.innerHTML='<a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/cardinal"> PLAY FOR FREE HERE </a><br>\n                    Platforming game made in 3 days using Unity and C# for \n                    <a href="https://itch.io/jam/speedjam5"> SpeedJam 5</a>, with the theme being "ascend".<br>\n                    This game reached 7th place overall out of 208 entries, which was a little lower than I had wanted, but it was still a good ranking nonetheless.\n                    In this game you play as a bird trying to find its parents, while learning to fly. <br>\n                    I worked alone on this project and created all scripts, sprites and music.

I am quite happy with how the game looks and feels, but the difficulty remained slightly too\n                    much for some players. Additionally, some of the game design did not fit the overarching theme of the jam which was to make a speedrun game. Forcing\n                    the player to go slow at times was certainly a poor decision in this regard.
