We chose to use shaders for the hazard because it couldn\'t be \n                    represented by a static size sprite, and also because I was learning and wanted to apply my shader skills.\n\n                    The biggest draw to the game was that it required the player to press multiple keys at the same time - this being the core mechanic of the\n                    game. However, while both of us did not encounter any issues during playtesting, we soon learned after release that many keyboards\n                    were actually unable to press more than around 4-5 keys at the same time. This also varied between keyboards: hence both of our keyboards\n                    working perfectly fine for the game. We also did not have time to accomodate different keyboard layouts, although we did consider this.\n                    All things considered, I am a little disappointed that this issue with keyboards ruined the experience for many people, although the ones\n                    that did play through game seemed to very much enjoy it!\n\n                    ';break;case"lemur":n.innerHTML='<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/2903982?border_width=0&amp;bg_color=f4cfa9&amp;fg_color=cf36b8" width="550" height="165"><a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/lemur">LEMUR by arColm</a></iframe>',i.innerHTML='<a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/lemur"> PLAY FOR FREE HERE </a><br>\n                    Platforming puzzle game made in 4 days usign Unity and C# for\n                    <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2903982"> GMTK 2024 - Built to Scale </a>.\n                    I worked alone on this game, and it achieved an enjoyment rank of 942 out of 7589, top 12%.\n\n                    The concept behind the game was that you were "creating a build" to "scale a mountain". I think this concept was\n                    not very well received, as I supposed it was a bit of a cop-out from making a game for the actual theme - understandably.\n                    Making this game involved creating many different platforming features that the player could choose from, such as a grappling hook,\n                    double jump, dash and so on. There are also 2 endings, one of which is a secret ending that involved the player finding all the items and\n                    going through a more difficult course at the end of the game to reach a "true ending" of sorts.\n\n                    I tried to use this as a test to see how many features I could implement given the timeline of 4 days,\n                    especially since I had to do all of the art and sounds myself. On that note, I was also very happy with how the game looked, and in\n                    particular I am happy with the trees which enhance the feel of the game. I also attempted to create a sort of abstract narrative\n                    with not knowing what the player was: a robot trying to climb the mountain which was actually a seed for the sakura trees you see\n                    throughout the game. I don\'t think of the plot as anything particularly deep, but it was a bit more thought out than my other games.\n\n                    I am a little disappointed in the ratings, however I think making the game has taught me about my limits, and also enhanced my skills \n                    in other areas of game development.\n\n                    ';break;case"abyss":n.innerHTML='<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/2760795?bg_color=070918&amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;link_color=3afffb&amp;border_color=353438" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/abyss">abyss by arColm, elsidraws</a></iframe>',i.innerHTML='<a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/abyss"> PLAY FOR FREE HERE </a><br>\n                    Platforming game made in 3 days using Unity and C# for\n                    <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-160-light"> MiniJam 160 - Light </a>, with the limitation being "Speed is Key".\n                    Worked with artist <a href="https://linktr.ee/gisellepe"> @elsidraws </a>.<br><br>\n                    The game achieved rank 1 in Presentation, and rank 6 Overall. We were quite happy with the placement for presentation, and\n                    although much of it was because of the artist who drew all of the textures, I was quite happy with the particle effects and other\n                    visual effects that I contributed. The overall score was not as high as I had hoped, especially since this is one of my favorite games that I have\n                    made - but by looking at the criticisms we received, I believe it was more of a misunderstanding of the target audience in the game jam. I had\n                    attempted to make this game fairly easy, and everyone who had the chance to playtest it gave feedback that it was indeed easy. However,\n                    many people thought it was difficult, so while I hate to blame my audience, I think this is the best compromise between me wanting to\n                    make a challenging game, and a game that is easy to beat for a jam. Another significant reason for our downfall is likely due to\n                    poor tutorialization of the game, and we realized this after having some of our friends play after release, that the tutorial\n                    did not illustrate all of the mechanics very clearly.<br>\n                    My goal for this jam was to continue improving the organization and architecture of my games. In particular, I wanted to reduce the coupling between my scripts,\n                    and especially to stop myself from using a Singleton for the player, despite its convenience. To this extent I largely used events with the\n                    Observer pattern. On top of this, I wanted to continue practicing visual effects, which is can be shown in the lightning effect of the game.\n                    In the future I would have liked to experiment with implementing the lightning effect with shaders or compute shaders if possible, instead of\n                    a set of line renderers, but given the time constraint of the jam I did not have time to learn for the game. Finally, I also just\n                    wanted to improve my ability to work with someone else on a game, and I think we worked together much better this time around, finishing\n                    most of the game within 48 hours of the 72 hours alloted.<br>\n                    Overall I consider this a fairly successful game.\n                    ';break;case"cardinal":n.innerHTML='<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/2730814?border_width=0&amp;bg_color=00303b&amp;fg_color=f1f2da&amp;link_color=8c8d79&amp;border_color=333333" width="550" height="165"><a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/cardinal">CARDINAL by arColm</a></iframe>',i.innerHTML='<a href="https://pokerdf.itch.io/cardinal"> PLAY FOR FREE HERE </a><br>\n                    Platforming game made in 3 days using Unity and C# for \n                    <a href="https://itch.io/jam/speedjam5"> SpeedJam 5</a>, with the theme being "ascend".<br>\n                    This game reached 7th place overall out of 208 entries, which was a little lower than I had wanted, but it was still a good ranking nonetheless.\n                    In this game you play as a bird trying to find its parents, while learning to fly. <br>\n                    I worked alone on this project and created all scripts, sprites and music.

I am quite happy with how the game looks and feels, but the difficulty remained slightly too\n                    much for some players. Additionally, some of the game design did not fit the overarching theme of the jam which was to make a speedrun game. Forcing\n                    the player to go slow at times was certainly a poor decision in this regard.

The overall polish of this game was quite low, because\n                                                I wanted to participate in the Boss Rush Game Jam 2024 to create "Greed" as soon as possible to give myself\n                                                more time.
